# Building Load Forecasting
The goal of this project is to predict future energy consumption for several energy system types across thousands of buildings. To accomplish this, the following tools were employed using Python:
- Interactive dashboards for data exploration
- Time series entropy for faulty meter detection
- Interpolation algorithms, regression and classification machine learning algorithms for missing data estimation
- Facebook Prophet for time series forecasting

# Project Deliverables
Viewers can see my findings here:

- **Project Report.pdf**: Discussion of the project scope, all analysis, results and conclusions. 
- **Building Load Forecast.ipnby**: This document contains the entire workflow. Please note that Github only renders static charts. Hence, the figures in this notebook won't show up because they are interactive.
